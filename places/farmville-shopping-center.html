              <h1>Dr. N. P. Miller's Office/Farmville Shopping Center</h1>


	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Dr. Nathaniel Peyton Miller, a prominent African-American dentist, was active in many civic organizations, including the NAACP. While the Prince Edward County public schools were closed, Dr. Miller allowed the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker civil rights organization, to use his building as its headquarters when they came to help ameliorate race relations.</p>

	<p>Across the street, Farmville's first shopping center was a site of almost-daily picketing staged by the Prince Edward NAACP Youth Council beginning in July 1963. The demonstrations were a product of growing frustration of younger African-Americans with the slow pace of the legal process to open the schools as well as the lack of employment opportunities available downtown. The protests marked a shift in tactics from the courtroom to the streets to challenge segregation. </p>

		This building was constructed in 1939 to house 180 students. [more about being constructed with PWA funds, housed grades 8-12, tar paper shacks, overcrowding led to strike; used as a school until the 1990s; named for Robert R. Moton, second principal of Tuskegee Institute ] 
		</p>
		<p>
		The Martha E. Forrester Council of Women was instrumental in raising funds to purchase the building from the county and preserve it as a museum.  The school was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and opened as a museum in 2001.  The six-gallery permanent exhibition, The Moton School Story: Children of Courage, opened in 2013.  Museum hours are 12 noon -- 4 p.m. Monday - Saturday; free admission.
