  <p>Farmville stood at the heart of the struggle over the meaning of freedom and equality in twentieth-century America. Young people played a defining role in this movement.  In 1951, over 450 students, led by 16-year-old Barbara Johns, staged a walkout at the Robert R. Moton High School to protest the inadequate and overcrowded facilities African-Americans faced. Their action launched a 13-year legal fight that expanded equality for all Americans.   </p>
  <p>The Moton student strike resulted in the Davis v. Prince Edward case that the Supreme Court bundled together with four others in its landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which declared segregation in public education unconstitutional. </p>

<p>However, the struggle for educational equality in Prince Edward did not end there. In 1959 county officials, under a court order to desegregate, instead chose to defund the public schools, effectively closing them. While white students were educated at a newly created private academy, school-age African-Americans who remained in the county were locked out. The public schools remained closed for five years as the legal battle to reopen them stalled in the courts.  </p>

By July 1963, local young people were frustrated by the slow pace of change and were inspired by the broader civil rights movement then sweeping the South. They wanted to do more than just wait for the courts. Advised by the Rev. L. Francis Griffin of First Baptist Church, they planned direct action protests and encouraged citizens to boycott discriminatory merchants. The protests resulted in the hiring of the first African-American employee downtown and helped lead to the opening of the Prince Edward Free Schools, with assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice, in September 1963. In 1964, the Supreme Court decision Griffin v. Prince Edward ordered the reopening of public schools. </p>
