	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>When small groups of African-American students attempted to attend services at four downtown Farmville churches to integrate the traditionally white houses of worship on Sunday, July 28, 1963, Johns Memorial, built in 1882, was the only one into which they were admitted. Gordon Moss, the chief academic officer at Longwood College, invited the protesters to sit in his pew. One of only a few prominent, outspoken white voices against the closing of public schools, Moss's opposition incurred social and professional costs to he and his family, including his leadership role at Johns Memorial. Moss's home was located a block northeast at the current site of Bicentennial Park.</p>

		This building was constructed in 1939 to house 180 students. [more about being constructed with PWA funds, housed grades 8-12, tar paper shacks, overcrowding led to strike; used as a school until the 1990s; named for Robert R. Moton, second principal of Tuskegee Institute ] 
		</p>
		<p>
		The Martha E. Forrester Council of Women was instrumental in raising funds to purchase the building from the county and preserve it as a museum.  The school was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and opened as a museum in 2001.  The six-gallery permanent exhibition, The Moton School Story: Children of Courage, opened in 2013.  Museum hours are 12 noon -- 4 p.m. Monday - Saturday; free admission.
