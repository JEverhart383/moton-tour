	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>The Farmville <i>Herald</i>, published bi-weekly, was founded in 1890.  J. Barrye Wall purchased the Herald in 1921 and served as editor during the period of the school closings. Under Wall's leadership, the Farmville <i>Herald</i> was a strident opponent of the Brown decision and championed local efforts to thwart desegregation and establish a county-wide system of private schools.  Wall encouraged local citizens to "stand steady" against what he perceived as an overreaching federal government and the invasion of activist outsiders who disrupted the "harmonious" race relations in Farmville.</p>

		This building was constructed in 1939 to house 180 students. [more about being constructed with PWA funds, housed grades 8-12, tar paper shacks, overcrowding led to strike; used as a school until the 1990s; named for Robert R. Moton, second principal of Tuskegee Institute ] 
		</p>
		<p>
		The Martha E. Forrester Council of Women was instrumental in raising funds to purchase the building from the county and preserve it as a museum.  The school was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and opened as a museum in 2001.  The six-gallery permanent exhibition, The Moton School Story: Children of Courage, opened in 2013.  Museum hours are 12 noon -- 4 p.m. Monday - Saturday; free admission.
