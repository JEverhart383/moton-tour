	<h1>Place Name</h1>


	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>On April 23, 1951, a student walkout here set in motion more than a decade of struggle for educational equality in Prince Edward County. Led by Barbara Johns, the strike resulted in the Davis case, which became part of the Supreme Courtâ€™s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision declaring segregated education unconstitutional.  Rather than integrate, Prince Edward County closed the public schools from 1959 to 1964, when another Supreme Court decision reopened them.</p>

		This building was constructed in 1939 to house 180 students. [more about being constructed with PWA funds, housed grades 8-12, tar paper shacks, overcrowding led to strike; used as a school until the 1990s; named for Robert R. Moton, second principal of Tuskegee Institute ] 
		</p>
		<p>
		The Martha E. Forrester Council of Women was instrumental in raising funds to purchase the building from the county and preserve it as a museum.  The school was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and opened as a museum in 2001.  The six-gallery permanent exhibition, The Moton School Story: Children of Courage, opened in 2013.  Museum hours are 12 noon -- 4 p.m. Monday - Saturday; free admission.
