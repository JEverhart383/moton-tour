  <p>Prince Edward County and Farmville stood at the heart of the struggle over the meaning of freedom and equality in twentieth-century America. Young people played a defining role in this movement.  In 1951, over 450 students at the Robert R, Moton High School, led by sixteen-year-old Barbara Johns, staged a walkout to protest the inadequate and overcrowded facilities they faced. Their action launched a thirteen-year legal fight that expanded equality for all and moved America from a segregated to a more integrated society.  </p>

<p>The Moton student strike resulted in a court case decided by the Supreme Court in its landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which declared segregation in public education unconstitutional. The struggle for educational equality did not end there though.  In 1959, under court order to desegregate, county officials chose to defund the public schools, effectively closing them. They remained closed for five years as the legal battle to reopen them was slow and ponderous.  In 1964, another Supreme Court decision Griffin v. Prince Edward ordered the reopening of public schools.  </p>

<p>
By July 1963, local young people were frustrated by the slow pace of change and inspired by the broader civil rights movement then sweeping the South. They wanted to do more than just wait for the courts.  Advised by the Rev. L. Francis Griffin of First Baptist Church, they organized an NAACP Youth Council, planned direct action protests, and encouraged citizens to boycott merchants who discriminated. Soon after the protests a few downtown businesses hired their first black employees, but it would take the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to dismantle segregation more fully in Farmville.</p>
<p>
This tour guides you to sites in downtown Farmville significant to this history between 1951 and 1964.  The tour is designed to begin and end at the Moton Museum and takes you along Main Street, High Street, and Griffin Boulevard.  The length is about two miles, but you can begin and end the tour at any point.
